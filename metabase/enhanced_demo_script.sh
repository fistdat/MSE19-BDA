echo
echo "Database Scaling:"
echo "  - PostgreSQL: Read replicas for analytics queries"
echo "  - Trino: Add worker nodes for distributed processing"
echo "  - Iceberg: Partition by date/region for better performance"
echo
echo "Infrastructure Scaling:"
echo "  - Kafka: Scale to 3+ brokers for high availability"
echo "  - Flink: Increase parallelism and checkpointing"
echo "  - MinIO: Distributed setup with 4+ nodes"
echo
echo "Metabase Scaling:"
echo "  - Multiple instances with load balancer"
echo "  - Separate database for metadata"
echo "  - Redis cache for improved performance"

echo
echo "7.2. 💾 DATA RETENTION POLICIES:"
echo "  - Raw CDC events: 30 days in Kafka"
echo "  - Iceberg data: 7 years with tiered storage"
echo "  - Metabase queries: 90 days cache"
echo "  - Application logs: 30 days retention"

echo
echo "7.3. 🔒 SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS:"
echo "  - SSL/TLS for all connections"
